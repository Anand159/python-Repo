#Practice 2:
#List Slicing:
#List slicing is a way to get parts (or slices) of a list. It's like cutting a piece out of a list, just like you
#would cut a piece out of a cake.
#TASK:
#1. Create a list of the first 20 natural numbers.
#2. Slice the list to get the first 10 elements.
#3. Slice the list to get the last 5 elements.
#4. Print both slices.

natural=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]
print("Natural Number :- ",natural)
print("first 10 element slice",natural[:10])
print("last 5 element slice",natural[15:])
