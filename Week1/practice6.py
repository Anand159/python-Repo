#Practice 6:
#Nested Tuples
#1. Create a tuple that contains two nested tuples, each with three elements.
#2. Access the second element of the first nested tuple.
#3. Access the first element of the second nested tuple.
#4. Print both elements

Tuples=((1,2,3),(2,4,6))
print("nested tuples :- ",Tuples)
access=Tuples[0][1]
print(access)
acess2=Tuples[1][0]
print(acess2)
